            <b style="font-size:2rem ;"> AEEC Digital Manufacturing Technologies (AEEC DMT) </b>
            <br><br>
            Digital production technologies change traditional production processes and enable the development of
            innovative products faster and more efficiently, and play a key role in the concept of Industry 4.0. In this
            direction, AEEC DMT aims to carry out the following activities in order to study and meet the demands
            of the market:
            <br><br>
            
          <b>  1. Industrial design, evaluation, optimization and planning </b>
            Design, evaluation, optimization and planning of production units based on the use of Computer Aided
            Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) computer software packages.
            
            <br><br>
           <b> 2. Increasing Additive Manufacturing or 3D Printing activities </b>
            Additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer, often using materials such as plastics, metals and
            ceramics. It enables rapid prototyping, customization, and the creation of complex geometries that
            would be difficult or impossible using traditional manufacturing methods.
            <br><br>
          <b>  3. Use, operation and recovery of digital technologies: Internet of Things, Robotics and Automation </b> <br>
            It is important to build intelligent systems using digital technologies, including the organization of
            industrial robotization and automatic control. At the same time, building a system for this process can
            be integrated into production equipment to collect various data (quality, environment, safety, etc.).
            On the other hand, it is important to establish and start up technical services for the exploitation and
            restoration of digital technologies.
            <br> <br>
         <b>   4. Obtaining information from industry subjects. Storage, email and analytics (Data Analytics and
            Artificial Intelligence) </b>
            <br> <br>
            As a result of the construction of a digital industrial system, it is possible to obtain large volumes of data
            generated during production in order to gain insights into process efficiency, product quality, system
            safety, production chain optimality and other characteristics online in real time. At the same time,
            remote data acquisition. Providing email and diagnostic solutions is of utmost importance. This allows
            identifying development trends and potential problems in the mentioned areas, optimizing production
            processes, predicting maintenance needs and improving quality control by making informed decisions.
            At the same time, it allows the establishment of a remote reading, identification and diagnostic system
            (RIDS): RIDS establishment for vehicles, electrical equipment, biomedical technologies, CNC, sports,
            utility, household and other equipment.
