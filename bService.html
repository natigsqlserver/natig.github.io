            <b style="font-size:2rem ;">  AEEC E-Mobility and Green Energy Technologies </b>
            <br> <br>
            E-mobility refers to the use of electric vehicles and partly enables the transition from fuel-powered
            transport to cleaner transport options that have less impact on the environment.
            Green energy is aimed at the creation and use of clean energy sources that are renewable and do little
            harm to the environment.<br>
            In this way, E-mobility technologies and Green energy technologies are based on complementary
            technologies, and the keystone of these technologies is to protect the environment and reduce fuel
            dependence, and serve the implementation of the relevant goals of the Sustainable Development Goals.
            Therefore, both technologies are considered together and given E-Mobility and Green Energy
            Technologies as the main activity direction. <br>
            The activity in this direction is aimed at the following directions:
            <br><br>
          <b>  1. Provision of technical services for Electric Vehicles (EV). </b> <br>
            Mainly providing technical services for electric buses, motorcycles and scooters as well as charging
            infrastructure, especially e-mobility services. This includes electric motors and transmissions, power
            electronics, on-board charging devices and other services.
            <br><br>
           <b> 2. Design, construction and maintenance of charging stations for electric transport</b>
            Designing, construction, management, organization of payment systems and other services, and
            development of relevant software and applications. <br>
            Green energy technologies, especially the installation of solar and wind technology charging stations,
            the application of car-to-everything (V2X), including car-to-home (V2H), car-to-car (V2V) and car-to-grid
            (V2G) technology.g
            <br><br>
            
           <b> 3. Batteries: maintenance, reuse and recycling </b> <br>
            Construction, maintenance, reuse (second life batteries), recycling and disposal of batteries, integration
            with renewable energy and performing other related activities.
            <br><br>
          <b>  4. Providing services for the design, installation, restoration and operation management of renewable
            energy technologies. </b><br>
            Design, installation, maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, Wind turbines (onshore and
            offshore), Small-scale hydropower plants, Biomass power plants, Biofuel production and email,
            Geothermal heating and cooling systems, as well as operation based on software packages providing
            management services.  <br>
            At the same time, the development of energy storage technologies, monitoring systems and the
            necessary technologies for renewable energy sources, as well as the implementation of necessary
            forecasting and optimization work.
            <br> <br>
        <b>   5. Development of energy efficiency solutions and construction of Smart grid and energy management
            systems. </b>  <br>
            Energy-saving devices and lighting, Building Energy Management Systems, Energy auditing and
            consulting services, Smart meters and advanced metering infrastructure, Micro-grid solutions,
            <br> <br>
            Implementation of sustainable building technologies, including green roofs and walls, Passive solar
            design and insulation, Net-zero implementation of energy buildings and other energy efficient
            technologies.
