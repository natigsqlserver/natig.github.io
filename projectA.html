            development of new oil and gas production region (mainly Azerbaijan&#39;s offshore oil fields), like
            probability of falling wells to the productive sediment, probability for discovering fields of different class
            (in the depth of lying down and on their largeness), probability for discovering given number of fields,
            probability for discovering not less than given number of fields, mathematical expectation of number of
            fields due to discover and others in the region and so on. The optimization issue was formalized in
            accordance with achieving maximum profit on the basis of created model, and the possibilities of
